# Todo List
A simple todo list app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a task in the input box and click the plus icon.
3. Use the checkbox to mark tasks as completed.
4. Click the trash icon to delete a task.

The app saves your tasks automatically using localStorage, so your tasks will still be there when you reload the page or close your web browser.

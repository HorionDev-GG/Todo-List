# Todo List
A simple todo list app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a task in the input box and click the plus icon.
3. Use the checkbox to mark tasks as completed.
4. Click the trash icon to delete a task.

The app saves your tasks automatically using localStorage, so your tasks will still be there when you reload the page or close your web browser.

This project uses Bootstrap CSS to style the app components.
